## Compatibility

The emulator is capable of running most commercial games at full speed, provided you meet the necessary hardware requirements.

For a list of games yuzu supports, please be patient as this will come eventually.

Check out our [website](W.I.P) for the latest news on exciting features, monthly progress reports, and more!

## Development

Most of the development happens on our git. It's also where [our central repository](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden) is hosted. For development discussion, please wait join us on [Discord](W.I.P) once it's public.

If you want to contribute we are open to new devs and prs, please make sure your work is of a high standard and you have properly documented it.
You can also contact any of the developers on Discord in order to know about the current state of the emulator.

If you want to contribute to the user interface translation project, please check out the [yuzu project on transifex](https://www.transifex.com/yuzu-emulator/yuzu). We centralize translation work there, and periodically upstream translations.
